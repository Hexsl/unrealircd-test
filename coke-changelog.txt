Finished variations relative to original repo:

* servicebot.c - has been altered to allow O-lined users to toggle the mode on themselves.
* api-usermodes.c - has been altered to allow opers to toggle the r (registered user) mode.

WIP changes:

* Augment swhois.c to change /swhois from a server command to a user-executiable one by opers-only.
* Allow opers to execute most svs* commands (see above); ensure appropriate limits and syncing to prevent OS RAW-esque damage.
* Create logs for new user commands.
